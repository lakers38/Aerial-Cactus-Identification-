# Aerial-Cactus-Identification
The fields of geospatial data analysis is something is growing and in the future can help us gain unique insights that
influnece certain areas such as agriculture, trade patterns, and global climate phenomenon. This project was done in order to be able
to develop a model that can identify specific labeled objects in aerial images. In this case the model was run to classify whether certain 
images had  cacti or not. The dataset for this project was retrieved from the related Kaggle competition.
